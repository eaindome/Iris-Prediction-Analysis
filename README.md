# Iris-Prediction-Analysis
Analyzing the Iris Flowers dataset and making predictions
In this repository, there are 3 notebooks and 1 csv file.
The csv file contains the data for this prediction analysis.
The 3 notebooks are:
1. Iris Flower Prediction Analysis which is the final product
2. Iris Flower Analysis which contains all the experiments on data visualization and model selection. You can check all the models I tried before selecting a the best one.
3. Iris dataset analysis which was my first time attempting this challeng. Not really necessary but you can check it out
